# Visual Comparison: Current vs Figma Reference

## Key Differences to Address

### Typography
- Figma uses larger, bolder headlines with more dramatic sizing
- Need tighter letter-spacing on headlines
- Monospace font for certain technical elements
- More dramatic size contrast between headline and body

### Layout & Spacing
- Figma has more generous padding/margins
- Sections have more vertical breathing room
- Grid layouts need tighter alignment
- Border decorations and grid patterns visible in Figma

### Visual Elements
- Decorative ASCII/code patterns in background
- Thin border lines creating visual grid structure
- More prominent use of decorative corners/brackets
- Code block styling with line numbers
- Terminal/CLI aesthetic elements

### Color & Contrast
- Firecrawl uses light background (we're using dark)
- Orange accent color (we're converting to purple)
- Subtle gradient backgrounds
- More pronounced border visibility

### Components Needing Refinement
1. Hero section - needs more dramatic typography
2. Feature cards - need better visual separation
3. Stats section - numbers need to be MUCH larger
4. Code/terminal elements - need monospace styling
5. Borders and dividers - need to be more prominent
6. Overall spacing - needs to be more generous

## Action Items
- Increase headline font sizes significantly
- Add decorative border elements
- Improve card styling with better shadows/borders
- Make stat numbers much more prominent
- Add more padding throughout
- Consider adding decorative code/ASCII elements
